## **Lists and Dictionaries with For Loops, List Comprehension, and Dictionary Comprehension**

In this video, we will learn how to use `for` loops with **Lists** and **Dictionaries**, followed by advanced techniques using **List Comprehension** and **Dictionary Comprehension**. These tools are essential for writing concise and efficient Python code.

---

### **1. Looping Through Lists**

A `for` loop is the most common way to iterate through items in a list.

#### **Example**: Sum of all numbers in a list
```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
total = 0

for num in numbers:
    total += num

print("Total sum:", total)
```

**Output**:
```
Total sum: 150
```

#### **Example**: Doubling each number in a list
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled = []

for num in numbers:
    doubled.append(num * 2)

print("Doubled List:", doubled)
```

**Output**:
```
Doubled List: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

#### **Example**: Printing Kannada food items
```python
foods = ["Dosa", "Idli", "Vada", "Bisibelebath"]

for food in foods:
    print(f"I like {food}")
```

**Output**:
```
I like Dosa
I like Idli
I like Vada
I like Bisibelebath
```

### **2. Looping Through Dictionaries**

You can use `for` loops to iterate over dictionaries by accessing both keys and values.

#### **Example**: Iterating over dictionary keys
```python
student_marks = {"Anand": 85, "Geetha": 90, "Kumar": 78}

for student in student_marks:
    print(student)
```

**Output**:
```
Anand
Geetha
Kumar
```

#### **Example**: Iterating over dictionary values
```python
student_marks = {"Anand": 85, "Geetha": 90, "Kumar": 78}

for marks in student_marks.values():
    print(marks)
```

**Output**:
```
85
90
78
```

#### **Example**: Iterating over both keys and values
```python
student_marks = {"Anand": 85, "Geetha": 90, "Kumar": 78}

for student, marks in student_marks.items():
    print(f"{student} scored {marks} marks")
```

**Output**:
```
Anand scored 85 marks
Geetha scored 90 marks
Kumar scored 78 marks
```

### **3. `for` Loops with `range()`**

You can also use `for` loops with the `range()` function to loop through a sequence of numbers.

#### **Example**: Adding marks to students using index values
```python
students = ["Anand", "Geetha", "Kumar"]
marks = [85, 90, 78]

student_marks = {}

for i in range(len(students)):
    student_marks[students[i]] = marks[i]

print(student_marks)
```

**Output**:
```
{'Anand': 85, 'Geetha': 90, 'Kumar': 78}
```

### **4. List Comprehension**

List comprehension provides a more concise way to create lists by applying an expression to each element in an existing list.

#### **Syntax**:
```python
new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

#### **Example 1**: Squaring numbers in a list
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [num ** 2 for num in numbers]
print(squares)
```

**Output**:
```
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

#### **Example 2**: Filtering even numbers
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)
```

**Output**:
```
[2, 4, 6]
```

#### **Example 3**: Uppercasing Kannada city names
```python
cities = ["Bengaluru", "Mysuru", "Hubballi", "Mangaluru"]
uppercased_cities = [city.upper() for city in cities]
print(uppercased_cities)
```

**Output**:
```
['BENGALURU', 'MYSURU', 'HUBBALLI', 'MANGALURU']
```

### **5. Dictionary Comprehension**

Similar to list comprehension, dictionary comprehension provides a concise way to create dictionaries.

#### **Syntax**:
```python
new_dict = {key_expression: value_expression for item in iterable if condition}
```

#### **Example 1**: Creating a dictionary of squares
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares_dict = {num: num ** 2 for num in numbers}
print(squares_dict)
```

**Output**:
```
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

#### **Example 2**: Converting a list of names to a dictionary of name lengths
```python
names = ["Anand", "Geetha", "Kumar"]
name_lengths = {name: len(name) for name in names}
print(name_lengths)
```

**Output**:
```
{'Anand': 5, 'Geetha': 6, 'Kumar': 5}
```

#### **Example 3**: Filtering cities with population above 10 lakhs (Localized Example)
```python
city_population = {
    "Bengaluru": 84,
    "Mysuru": 11,
    "Hubballi": 9,
    "Mangaluru": 5
}
large_cities = {city: population for city, population in city_population.items() if population > 10}
print(large_cities)
```

**Output**:
```
{'Bengaluru': 84, 'Mysuru': 11}
```

### **Homework**

1. **List Manipulation**:
   - Create a list of Kannada foods. Use list comprehension to create a new list where each food name is in uppercase.

2. **Sum of Prices**:
   - Create a dictionary of 5 items with their prices. Write a program that calculates the total price of all items using a `for` loop.

3. **List of Squares**:
   - Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10. Use list comprehension to generate a list of their squares.

4. **Student Data Task**:
   - Create a list of 3 dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the name, age, and marks of a student. Loop through the list and print each student's information.

5. **Dictionary Comprehension**:
   - Create a dictionary where the keys are Kannada cities, and the values are their populations. Use dictionary comprehension to filter out cities with populations below 10 lakhs.
